Features that would make this pop:

 - Support for very fast inputs - right now, is dropping a significant amount of inputs at higher speeds. May need to go to different platform?

 - If game is built to be a "survival" style mode, then have it do a visual representation / review of the last measure you got wrong 
    (at least, maybe show point representations of each?)

 - visual, live histogram of input data showing when input is registered and for how long
    ( https://epochjs.github.io/epoch/real-time/ )

 - add gamepad?

     window.addEventListener("gamepadconnected", (e) => {
        console.log(
          "Gamepad connected from index %d: %s",
          e.gamepad.index,
          e.gamepad.id,
          e.gamepad.buttons.length,
          e.gamepad.axes.length,
        );


    });

    window.addEventListener("gamepaddisconnected", (e) => {
        console.log(
          "Gamepad disconnected from index %d: %s",
          e.gamepad.index,
          e.gamepad.id,
        );
    });

 - add more than one key for input

 - add a gif of a mouse that progresses some determined amount of frames (maybe based off of )

 Housekeeping things:

 - divide all the event listeners into a file, and / or figure out a better way to organize them
 
 - use this equalizer thing somewhere, free to use?

   - bytecode to protect app?
